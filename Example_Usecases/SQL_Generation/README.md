## SQL Generation from Natural Language using LLM Fine-Tuning
This repository provides tools and guidelines for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) specifically for generating SQL queries from natural language input. This process, known as Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL), is crucial for developing intuitive interfaces for database interaction.

## Overview
he project focuses on adapting LLMs to understand natural language queries and translate them into corresponding SQL queries. This can significantly enhance user interaction with databases, making data querying accessible to non-technical users.

## Repository Structure
### Env Setup
environment_setup.py: Sets up the necessary libraries and development environment.
### Dataset Prep
dataset_preparation.py: Prepares the NL2SQL dataset, with an example using the Spider dataset.
### Model Training
model_training.py: Contains the logic for fine-tuning an LLM for SQL generation, using appropriate sequence-to-sequence models.
### Model Testing
model_evaluation.py: Script for evaluating the fine-tuned model's performance, focusing on the accuracy of SQL query generation.
### Model Deployment
model_deployment.py: GMain script that orchestrates the environment setup, dataset preparation, model training, and evaluation.
utility_functions.py: Provides additional helper functions used across the project.
requirements.txt: Lists all necessary Python libraries and their versions.

### Getting Started
Setup: Run environment_setup.py to install required dependencies.
Prepare Dataset: Use dataset_preparation.py to load and preprocess the dataset.
Train Model: Execute model_training.py to start the fine-tuning process.
Evaluate Model: Use model_evaluation.py to assess the performance of the trained model.

### Dataset
This project uses the following datasets for NL2SQL:

Spider Dataset: A large-scale, cross-domain semantic parsing and text-to-SQL dataset.
WikiSQL Dataset: A dataset for developing natural language interfaces for relational databases.

### Requirements
Ensure Python is installed on your system. This project is developed and tested on Python 3.8. GPU resources are recommended for model training and fine-tuning.

## Usage
To use this repository, clone it, install the requirements, and follow the sequential steps outlined above. Each script is well-documented with comments to guide you through the process.

## Dockerization
This project includes Docker support for easy setup and deployment. Dockerizing the application simplifies the process of managing the project's environment and dependencies.

Building the Docker Image
To build the Docker image, use the following command in the project's root directory (where the Dockerfile is located):

bash
 
Build and Run the Docker Container
To build and run the Docker container, use the following commands:

bash
Copy code
```
docker build -t nl2sql-llm-finetuning .
```

This command builds a Docker image named nl2sql-llm-finetuning based on the instructions in your Dockerfile.

Running the Application in a Docker Container
After building the image, you can run the application in a Docker container using:
bash
Copy code
```
docker run -p 4000:80 nl2sql-llm-finetuning

```
This command starts a Docker container running your fine-tuned LLM application, mapping the container's port 80 to port 4000 on your host machine.

Docker Best Practices
Ensure all necessary files for the project are included in the Docker context and correctly referenced in the Dockerfile.
Keep sensitive data and credentials out of the Docker image. Use environment variables or Docker secrets for managing such information.
Regularly update the base image and dependencies for security updates.
