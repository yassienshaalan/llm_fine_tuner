## Fine-Tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)
This repository provides a comprehensive guide and tools for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) using Hugging Face TRL, Transformers, and Datasets libraries. The focus is on demonstrating how to fine-tune open LLMs for specific tasks, such as generating SQL queries from natural language instructions.

## Overview
Fine-tuning LLMs can significantly enhance their performance for specialized tasks. This repository walks through the entire process, including defining a use case, setting up the environment, preparing datasets, fine-tuning the model, evaluating its performance, and deploying it for production.

## Repository Structure
### Env Setup
environment_setup.py: Sets up the necessary libraries and development environment.
### Dataset Prep
dataset_preparation.py: Handles the creation and preparation of the dataset for fine-tuning.
### Model Training
model_training.py: Contains code for fine-tuning the LLM using techniques like supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with the SFTTrainer.
### Model Testing
model_evaluation.py: Used for evaluating the fine-tuned model's performance on test datasets.
### Model Deployment
model_deployment.py: Guides through deploying the fine-tuned model for production use.
utility_functions.py: Provides additional helper functions used across the project.
requirements.txt: Lists all necessary Python libraries and their versions.

### Getting Started
Environment Setup: Run environment_setup.py to install all required libraries and set up the development environment.
Dataset Preparation: Use dataset_preparation.py to prepare your training and testing datasets.
Model Training: Execute model_training.py to fine-tune the LLM on your prepared dataset.
Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using model_evaluation.py.
Model Deployment: Follow the instructions in model_deployment.py for deploying your model in a production environment.
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system and the necessary hardware (preferably GPUs) to train the models. The scripts are tailored for consumer-grade GPUs like NVIDIA A10G or RTX 4090/3090 but can be adapted for larger setups.

## Usage
To use this repository, clone it, install the requirements, and follow the sequential steps outlined above. Each script is well-documented with comments to guide you through the process.
## Docker
